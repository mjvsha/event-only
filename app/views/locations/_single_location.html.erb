<!-- no instance variables are used here bc this partial page isjust used for rendering pages, from other methods
so we are gonna call a method from another page which will have the instance variable, and then its local variable will be subbed here  -->

<div class="location">
  <h3><%= location.name %></h3>
  <h4>City: <%= location.city %></h4>
  <%= location.description %> <br>
  <%= link_to image_tag(location.image, class: "location"), location_path(location) %>
